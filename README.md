## Description

The ISR IOT TCP classes provide rudimentary methods for communicating with LXI instruments in mobile and desktop platforms.

Unlike VXI-11 or HiSlip, these classes do not implement the bus level method for issuing device clear, reading service requests or responding to instrument initiated event. While  control ports for these methods are available in some Keysight instruments, these ports are not part of the standard LXI framework.

## Issues

### read after write delay is required  for Async methods
A delay of 1 ms is required for implementing the asynchronous query method using the TCP Client write and read asynchronous methods. Neither the console nor unit tests are succeptible to this issue. 

## Supported .NET Releases

* .NET Standard 2.0 - source code framework)
* .NET 6.0
* .NET 7.0
* .NET MAUI
* Windows Forms
* WPF

## Source Code
Clone the repository along with its requisite repositories to their respective relative path.

### Repositories
The repositories listed in [external repositories] are required:
* [IDE Repository] - IDE support files.

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:davidhary/vs.ide.git
git clone https://github.com/ATECoder/dn.iot.tcp.git
```

Clone the repositories into the following folders (parents of the .git folder):
```
%vslib%\core\ide
%dnlib%\iot\tcp
```
where %dnlib% and %vslib% are  the root folders of the .NET libraries, e.g., %my%\lib\vs 
and %my%\libraries\vs, respectively, and %my% is the root folder of the .NET solutions

### Global Configuration Files
ISR libraries use a global editor configuration file and a global test run settings file. 
These files can be found in the [IDE Repository].

Restoring Editor Configuration:
```
xcopy /Y %my%\.editorconfig %my%\.editorconfig.bak
xcopy /Y %vslib%\core\ide\code\.editorconfig %my%\.editorconfig
```

Restoring Run Settings:
```
xcopy /Y %userprofile%\.runsettings %userprofile%\.runsettings.bak
xcopy /Y %vslib%\core\ide\code\.runsettings %userprofile%\.runsettings
```
where %userprofile% is the root user folder.
